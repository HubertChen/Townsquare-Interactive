Minister of Agriculture and Fishing Sigurður Ingi Jóhannsson told RÚV just moments ago that Sigmundur has resigned as the Prime Minister. This move still needs the approval of the Independence Party, and the President, before being official.  Sigmundur will remain on as chairperson of the Progressive Party, and Sigurður Ingi will take his place as Prime Minister. Sigurður said that they want to continue their partnership with the Independence Party, and do not recommend early elections at this time.  However, Independence Party chairperson Bjarni Benediktsson is currently meeting the President Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson to discuss the current situation.  Sigurður has publicly defended the Prime Minister since the Panama Papers story broke, going so far as to defend the use of offshore accounts by saying, “It is complicated to have money in Iceland.” Readers will be kept updated as developments arise."

Read more of The Independents North Korea coverage The Security Council passed a resolution in March, which expanded UN sanctions aimed at withholding funds for the Norths nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. It came after Pyongyang conducted four tests in recent months.  Among the North Korean materials to be banned, some of which are fundamental to the countrys revenue, are coal, iron, iron ore, gold, titanium and rare earths.  Life in North Korea captured with a mobile phone 30 show all While Chinas restrictions allow some North Korean materials to be imported for civilian use, any trade connected to the Norths missile or nuclear programmes has been prohibited. For the UN sanctions to succeed, the cooperation of China - an ally of North Korea - has been viewed as essential.  The move by China comes after the global Nuclear Security Summit held in Washington last week. There, at a meeting between Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping, the US President said both countries were “committed to the [denuclearisation] of the Korean Peninsula”.  Play 0:00 / 0:51 Fullscreen Mute Share North Korea propaganda video depicts imagined attack on Washington Mr Xi said: “China and the US have a responsibility to work together.” After the vote on the resolution, drafted by the US and China, US Ambassador Samantha Power said the sanctions were the toughest yet, Reuters reported.  Virtually all of the DPRKs (North Korea) resources are channelled into its reckless and relentless pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, she said.  UN sanctions have been imposed on North Korea since 2006 because of the countrys nuclear tests and rocket launches."

Plumes of exhaust steam, a byproduct of heating the main plant at the Yongbyon Radiochemical Laboratory complex, have been seen in commercial satellite images taken March 12 and over the preceding five weeks, the group says.  Trump on potential war between Japan and North Korea: If they do, they do This activity is unusual, the report by the Washington, D.C.-based project, says.  Exhaust plumes have rarely been seen there and none have been observed on any examined imagery this past winter, the report says.  The plumes suggest that the operators of the reprocessing facility are heating their buildings, perhaps indicating that some significant activity is being undertaken, or will be in the near future.

Separate images appear to show further work on the sites Experimental Light Water Reactor (ELWR), a key facility for the enrichment of nuclear fuel, is ongoing, with a new transformer yard and road built, and the installation of electrical cables completed.  The report states that slow, steady progress is being made on this component of Pyongyangs nuclear project.  Construction of new buildings near the Uranium Enrichment Complex is also ongoing, with some buildings nearing completion and new projects started. While there is speculation as to the purpose of these new buildings, the report says evidence is insufficient to reach any firm conclusions.

            "text": "A federal judge has approved BP’s $20 billion settlement over its 2010 oil spill, the Associated Press reports. First reached in October, the final settlement amount accounts for civil claims against the company set forth by the Department of Justice and five Gulf states. US Attorney General Loretta Lynch previously called the settlement the largest with a single entity in American history. While $5.5 billion will go toward penalties incurred under the Clean Water Act, most of the money will be given to five states — Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas — and 400 local government entities to cover damages from the spill. BP has already spent a reported $28 billion on cleanup and compensation. The Deepwater Horizon incident occurred after an offshore oil rig exploded in the Gulf of Mexico and consequently dumped 4.9 million barrels of oil into the surrounding water. Eleven people were killed and marine life in the area was devastated."

            "text": "A British banker who spent two decades living in communist North Korea set up a secret offshore finance company allegedly used by the Pyongyang regime to help sell arms and expand its nuclear weapons programme.  Nigel Cowie – a fluent Korean and Chinese speaker, who studied at Edinburgh University – was behind a Pyongyang front company, DCB Finance Limited, registered in the British Virgin Islands, papers show.  He says DCB Finance was used for legitimate business and that he was unaware of any unlawful transactions.  Cowie moved to North Korea in 1995 when Kim Jong-il was in power, and went on to become head of its first foreign bank, Daedong Credit Bank. Initially operating out of a ramshackle Pyongyang hotel with a staff of three, Cowie led a consortium that in 2006 bought a 70% stake in the bank.  A world of hidden wealth: why we are shining a light offshore Huge leak reveals how the powerful exploit secretive tax regimes – and widen the gulf between rich and poor Read more Giving his address as Pyongyang’s International House of Culture, he registered DCB Finance Limited, an offshoot of the bank, in the BVI in summer 2006, with a senior North Korean official, Kim Chol-sam. The Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca incorporated the company, despite North Korea being an obvious high-risk destination.  That July Kim Jong-il signalled his defiance of US sanctions by firing seven ballistic missiles. In October, North Korea carried out its first nuclear weapons test with a controlled underground explosion. The ensuing diplomatic crisis saw the UN impose asset freezes and and travel and trade bans.  In 2013, the US imposed sanctions on Daedong and Cowie’s front company, DCB, as well as on Kim Chol-sam. It alleged the bank provided “financial services” to North Korea’s main arms dealer, the Korea Mining Development Corporation, and its main financial arm, Tanchon Commercial Bank, which were subject to sanctions for the “central role they play supporting North Korea’s illicit nuclear and ballistic missiles programs”."

            "text": "“The terrorists fired rockets carrying mustard gas” and targeting the airbase in the south of Dayr al-Zawr city, Syria’s Ikhbariyah television station said in a statement late Monday.  The report did not disclose whether there were any casualties. Russia’s RIA Novosti, however, cited a military source as saying that “a number of soldiers were choking.” Last January, the Syrian army managed to drive back Daesh from several villages near the airbase. Operations are still underway, however, to totally remove them.  Mustard gas can form large blisters on exposed skin and in the respiratory tract, severely complicating breathing. It is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention.  Daesh earlier claimed that it had carried out an attack on Jufrah Village near the airbase. The report said two bombers rammed their explosives-laden vehicles into the army defenses and killed at least ten people.  Daesh, which is notorious for its barbarity, heinous atrocities and sacrilegious acts, has been accused of committing gross human rights violations and war crimes in the areas it has overrun, particularly in Syria and Iraq. The group has used chemical weapons in both countries.  Back in March, local Iraqi governor Najmuddin Kareem told Reuters that the group had used “poisonous substances” during an attack on the village of Taza, in northern Iraq. More than 40 people suffered from partial chocking and skin irritation after the attack.  On August 21, 2013, a chemical weapon was used in the Ghouta suburb of Damascus. Hundreds of people died in the attack. According to reports, the rockets used in the assault were handmade and contained sarin.  A report by the Syrian-American Medical Society said Daesh has carried out more than 160 attacks involving “poisonous or asphyxiating agents, such as sarin, chlorine, and mustard gas” since the beginning of the Syrian conflict in 2011. At least 1,491 people have been killed in the chemical attacks.  The so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says at least 270,000 people have been killed in war-ravaged Syria; however, some reports put the death toll as high as 470,000."

According to the probe by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) with the German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung and other media, including Haaretz, the leaked data from Mossack Fonseca, from 1975 to the end of last year, provides what the ICIJ described as a “never-before-seen view inside the offshore world.” The documents, from 214,000 entities, detail the offshore holdings of a dozen current and former world leaders, as well as businessmen, criminals, celebrities and sports stars.

Although Russian President Vladimir Putin’s name is not mentioned in the documents, his close associates “secretly shuffled as much as $2 billion through banks and shadow companies,” the ICIJ said.  Among the Israeli names found in the leaked documents are that of top attorney Dov Weisglass, former bureau chief of the late prime minister Ariel Sharon, Jacob Engel, a businessman active in the African mining industry, and Idan Ofer, a member of one of Israel’s wealthiest families, according to Haaretz.

Weisglass’s name appears as a sole owner of one of four companies set up by his business partner Assaf Halkin. The company, Talaville Global, was registered in the British Virgin Islands in May 2012, according to Haaretz, and seven months later, all of its shares were mortgaged against a loan from a Vienna bank. Weisglass and Halkin told Haaretz that the company “was registered for the purpose of receiving a loan from the bank in order to invest in European properties. The bank would only allow a loan to a corporation… [the] “company activity is reported to the tax authorities in Israel. The required tax on the said activity is paid in Israel.”"
